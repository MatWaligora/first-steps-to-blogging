# First steps to blogging

To keep it a simple demo I didn't do any database connection here. 
All data with posts is kept within node instance only during server runtime.
You will lose data if you restart the page.

## Run Setup

Open three terminal instances

1. cd server && npm start
2. cd adminpanel && npm run dev
2. cd app && npm run dev

Application ports:

Server: localhost:9000
Adminpanel: localhost:5000
App: localhost:3000
